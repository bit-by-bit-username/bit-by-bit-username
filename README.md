# 👋 Hello, I'm Bit by Bit

🎯 I’m building my life one bit at a time — through code, creativity, and curiosity.

🔎 I explore the intersection of:
- 🤖 Artificial Intelligence & Data Science
- 🔬 Physics Simulations & Scientific Computing
- 🧮 Math (especially geometry!)

📺 **Coming soon:** My YouTube channel — sharing bold projects like:
- 🧠 Creating an app to manage my life
- 🧮 Rebuilding geometry engines from scratch
- 🔌 Making a computer, bit by bit
  
  🌱 I'm learning in public. Building in public. Failing in public.  
And I believe that’s the best way to grow.
